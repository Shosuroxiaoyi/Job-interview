SparkFun is a dog-friendly environment. Are comfortable working aroung dogs? If you are a dog-owner, would you see yourself bringing a dog to work?
####I love dogs, if I had a dog I would bring it into work for sure.

The active sysadmin keeps up on happenings in the world of development and technology. Where do you you get your news?\par

####In regards to Networking;
#####Debian Security mailing list, Cisco security mailing list, linuxsecurity.com, /r/networking subreddit, SANS institute blogs, and darknet (ethical hacking).  \par

####General technology:
#####I still read toms hardware, I love Anandtech's hardware reviews,  always a fan of pc perspective.  I'm forced to emerse myself in the arduino and stack exchange forums daily for work which keeps a lot of crazy information about hobbyiest electronics floating about.

####Regular news:
#####I like to listen to public radio and have a subscription to the New York Times though I only manage to make it through more than the crossword puzzles maybe two days a week.

The sane sysadmin does things other than managing systems. What else occupies your time?
####I paint models, skateboard, play with electronics, build strange contraptions, am an avid roleplayer and enjoy staying current on as many SciFi video games and books as possible.

The worldly sysadmin is in touch with some form of culture (books, music, film, etc.). How do you go about feeding this part of your brain?
####Right now I really enjoy Brandon Sanderson's mix of fantasy and scifi in the Mistborn series.  In terms of music, I tend to listen to an eclectic assortment, but mostly videogame chiptune mixes and cheesy glory metal bands.  I rarely watch film unless it's a documentary or something that all of my friends are going to see - with the exception of anything that Studio Ghibli puts out... I'm kinda of a Ghibli fanatic, it shaped a lot of my childhood.
